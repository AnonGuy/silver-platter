Backends:
- Support for Mercurial
- Support for Svn
- Submit patches against non-Vcs packages to the BTS?

* Provide a way to opt out

* Read apt lists from HTTP, rather than local system

* Create cherry-pick merge proposals for bug fixes that are forwarded upstream
 + especially for stable debian releases

Upstream changes:
* pngcrush
* FSF

For packages that are known reproducible:
 * Build before the changes
 * Build after the changes
 * If there is no delta in the output package (except for certain files), tag && upload
