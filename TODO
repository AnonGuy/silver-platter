Backends:
- Support for Mercurial
- Support for Svn
- Submit patches against non-Vcs packages to the BTS?

* Provide a way to opt out
 + Allow pull requests that update policy.conf?
 + Some web link that edits the policy file automatically?

* Read apt lists from HTTP, rather than local system

* Create cherry-pick merge proposals for bug fixes that are forwarded upstream
 + especially for stable debian releases

* For "push" packages, don't require an associated hoster - make changes, commit, push back
 + Still need a way to convert "public read-only URL" to "writeable URL"

* Maintain some optional state
 + Last time a branch was checked
 + Where the merge proposal is

* Clean up merged merge proposals
 + Can't clean up ones that were closed, otherwise we'd create them again from scratch. :(

Upstream changes:
* pngcrush
* FSF
